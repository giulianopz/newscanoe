## Newscanoe

Newscanoe is a minimalistic and no-frills reimplementation of the glorious [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/): 
- only for Linux terminal emulators
- written in Go but rigorously nonglamorous
- meant to be lighter and easier to build from source or to distribute (in the future) in a distribution-independent package format such as Snap, Flatpak, or AppImage.


The only prerequisite is a file containing only urls of RSS/Atom feeds line-by-line (see the [urls sample file](./assets/urls)) located in the directory `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/newscanoe` or `$HOME/.config/newscanoe`.

Once loaded, feeds are cached in the directory `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/newscanoe` or `$HOME/.cache/newscanoe`.

> Warn: the project is still a WIP ðŸš§
